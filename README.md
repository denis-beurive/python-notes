**Tuples vs Lists**

A tuple is an assortment of data, separated by commas, which makes it similar to the Python list, but a tuple is fundamentally different in that a tuple is "immutable." This means that it cannot be changed, modified, or manipulated. 

**Sets vs Lists and Tuples**

Sets vs Lists and Tuples. Lists and tuples are standard Python data types that store values in a sequence. Sets are another standard Python data type that also store values. The major difference is that sets, unlike lists or tuples, **cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element** and **store unordered values**
